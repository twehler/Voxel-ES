# Voxel-ES
Voxel Evolution Simulation is an attempt to simulate natural evolution of life forms in a voxel-based world. Voxels will represent whole organisms, organs or even cells. The project is based on Machine Learning algorithms utilizing PyTorch, as well as the Panda3D game-engine, which allows for the coding in Python while keeping its backend in C++.
